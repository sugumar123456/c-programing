The program will output the value of the first element of the array a, which is 1.

Explanation:

The array a is a 3x4 array that is initialized with some values.
In the main() function, a pointer ptr is declared and initialized to point to the first element of a.
The fun() function is called with the address of ptr as an argument. Since ptr points to an integer, &ptr is a pointer to a pointer to an integer, which is what fun() expects as an argument.
Inside fun(), the value of the integer pointed to by the pointer to a pointer is printed, which is the first element of a, i.e., 1
