If the array begins at memory location 1200, the output of the program would be:
Output:
1200, 1200, 1200
This is because the memory address of the first element of the array (arr) and 
the memory address of the first element of the array using the indexing operator (&arr[0]) would be the same, 
which is the starting memory address of the array itself (&arr).
